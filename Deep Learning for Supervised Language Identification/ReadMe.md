# Deep Learning for Supervised Langaugae Identification
In this post, I primarily build approaches to see how Deep Learning performs in comparision to standard baselines for language detection for texts. Please note the text is in computer readable form i.e. this is not OCR (Optical Character Recognition) related experiment.

I employed [FastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) langauge package of Python to perform the task at hand.
